## General info
My journey to learning OpenGL using the C++ programming language. My goal is to understand the fundamentals of OpenGL based on the website "learnopengl.com" and Victor Gordan's Tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPaoO-vpZnumdcb4tZc4x5Q-v7CkrQ6M-). After that, I will gradually progress to the more advanced topics covered in the website.

## Topics covered so far
* Getting started: Linking necessary libraries
* Window creation and setting up OpenGL options
* Essential objects (VAO, VBO, EBO)
* Shaders (Vertex, Fragment)
* Abstraction
* Textures
* Going 3D
* Camera
* Phong Lighting (Ambient, Diffuse, Specular) + Specular Maps
* Types of light (Point, Directional, Spotlight)
* Mesh Class
* Model Loading using a custom importer
