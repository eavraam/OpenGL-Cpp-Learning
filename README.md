## General info
My journey to learning OpenGL using the C++ programming language. My goal is to understand the fundamentals of OpenGL based on the website "learnopengl.com" and Victor Gordan's Tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPaoO-vpZnumdcb4tZc4x5Q-v7CkrQ6M-). After that, I will gradually progress to the more advanced topics covered in the website.

## Topics covered so far

* Getting Started:
> 	Linking necessary Libraries,
	Window creation and setting up OpenGL options,
	Essential objects (VAO, VBO, EBO),
	Shaders (Vertex, Fragment),
	Abstraction,
	Textures,
	Going 3D,
	Camera.

* Into more detail:
> 	Phong Lighting (Ambient, Diffuse, Specular) + Specular Maps,
	Types of light (Point, Directional, Spotlight),
	Mesh Class,
	Model Loading using a custom importer.
	
* To the more advanced topics:
>	Depth testing, Z-fighting and fog effect.
