## General info
My journey to learning OpenGL using the C++ programming language. My goal is to understand the fundamentals of OpenGL based on the website "learnopengl.com" and Victor Gordan's Tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPaoO-vpZnumdcb4tZc4x5Q-v7CkrQ6M-). After that, I will gradually progress to the more advanced topics covered in the website.

Note: As a genius that I am, I do not keep every step of this journey as a separate step (Remembered that at the 20/30 tutorial video). However, more details on the process and the know-how of things can be found: i) in the commit history of github, ii) the source code of the tutorial.
